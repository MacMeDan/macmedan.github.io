A little background. We bought our first home and quickly realised the current layout of the kitchen was not condusive for more then one person to be in it at time. Our budget was $20,000 and it took about 3 months. I recoreded most of the work and composed it into a 17min timelapse video. So that is kida my TLDR on where you can see everything we did.
