    <p>Recently I have been working on a project for my kids. Of coarse since it was a new project I decided to do it in the newest version of Swift. I wanted to make some simple games that could help my young ones learn.
I love playgrounds and all that they enable us to do. I came across this project that <a href="https://twitter.com/uraimo">@uraimo</a> which has a running list of <a href="https://github.com/uraimo/Awesome-Swift-Playgrounds">Awesome Swift Playgrounds</a>. There is one for spriteKit Which I really wanted to make a game with but of coarse it was written in swift 2.2 I was not about to let that hold me back so I went ahead and started trying to  convert it to swift 3. I went through all the changes that Xcode suggested and finally made it to a point where I had no errors. The issue was that the example did not preform the way it did previously. After going back and converting each function 1 by 1. I determined the function that was not being called.</p>

<p>Then the next step was to figure out what I am missing but when I would try and find something it was already outdated. Even Apples documentation was for <code class="highlighter-rouge">objectiveC</code>. Then it hit me that this function was not that <code class="highlighter-rouge">swifty</code> which is what allot of the changes for swift 3 were all about. There is to much redundancy <code class="highlighter-rouge">func didBeginContact(contact: SKPhysicsContact) {</code> and there in lies the solution. See Xcode suggested to add the perimeter <code class="highlighter-rouge">contact:</code> and technically the method is valid so no errors were thrown. But this method is key for detecting collision between two objects and is the method that conforms to <code class="highlighter-rouge">SKPhysicsContactDelegate</code>.
  So since swift is aiming to be super readable if you take out the brackets it should read like a sentence of sorts. “did Begin Contact contact SKPhysicsContact” is a supper redundant sentence in my book. Take out the first contact and all is well. I don’t know why Xcode did not remove it when it added the parameter label like it does in many other instances but that is neither here nor there.</p>

<p>So I corrected my mistake and everything works just as it should.
Corrected Code :</p>

<p>Now I can explore changing variables and learn about <code class="highlighter-rouge">SpriteKit</code> more if you would like to check out the playground you can get the <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll">updated Swift 3 version here</a></p>
